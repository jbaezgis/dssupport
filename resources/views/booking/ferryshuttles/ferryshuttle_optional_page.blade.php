<p>Whenever you take our Shuttle & Ferry or Ferry & Shuttle Combination you will pass close to the National Park "Los Haitises" which is one of the highlights the Dominican Republic has to offer, but far away from everything - however you will be already very close on your trip from Punta Cana to Samana or from Samana to Punta Cana. So we invite you to either combine your journey with an excursion to the National Park or even better - do the excursion and spend one night at one of the most beauti-ful ECO hotels you have ever seen - the "Paraiso Caño Hondo" and continue the following day to your destination.</p>

<p>Private Los Haitises Tour: U$ 149.00 for Private Tour (approx. 3 hours by boat through the National Park "Los Haitises - pri-vate boat, guide, entrance fees and transportation from or to Pier Sabana de la Mar to Caño Hondo included) up to 2 persons (add U$ 25.00 for each additional person) - rest U$ 15 for each Child under 12 years accompanied by 2 adults.</p>

<p>Overnight at Paraiso Caño Hondo: 1 night at "Paraíso Caño Hondo" with breakfast and transportation from or to Pier Sabana de la Mar included (prices shown below apply in combination with Private Los Haitises Tour - add U$ 59.00 for each group which choses to stay in the hotel without booking the Tour - rest U$ 15.00 for each child under 12 years accompanied by 2 adults)</p>
